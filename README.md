## Project Goals
Provide a web server for us extracting url's information.

## Dependence
make sure PhantomJS is installed. This module expects the ```phantomjs``` binary to be in PATH somewhere. In other words, type this:

    $ phantomjs
    
If that works, you can do next.

## Install

    $ npm install

## Run

    $ node index
